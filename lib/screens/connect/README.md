# Connect Screen Refactored Structure

This directory contains the refactored `ConnectScreen` split into multiple files for better maintainability and separation of concerns.

## File Structure

### `connect_screen.dart`
- Main widget file that orchestrates all components
- Handles the widget lifecycle and state management initialization
- Minimal code that delegates to other components

### `connect_state_manager.dart`
- Contains all business logic and state management
- Handles socket connections, API calls, and state updates
- Manages filters, matching logic, and event handling
- Provides callbacks for UI updates

### `connect_ui_components.dart`
- Contains all UI building methods
- Handles the visual representation of different states
- Includes welcome screen, matching screen, and button components
- Static methods for reusable UI components

### `connect_filter_components.dart`
- Handles all filter-related UI components
- Contains filter dialogs, dropdowns, and premium feature cards
- Manages distance, language, age range, and interests filters

### `connect_dialog_components.dart`
- Contains all dialog and snackbar components
- Handles timeout dialogs, warning messages, and session management
- Provides consistent dialog styling and behavior

### `index.dart`
- Export file for easy importing of all connect components

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each file has a specific responsibility
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
3. **Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
4. **Reusability**: UI components can be reused in other parts of the app
5. **Readability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and navigate

## Usage

The main `ConnectScreen` widget can be used exactly as before - no changes to the public API. All the internal complexity has been organized into separate files while maintaining the same functionality.

## State Management

The `ConnectStateManager` uses a callback pattern to communicate with the UI layer, ensuring loose coupling between business logic and presentation.
