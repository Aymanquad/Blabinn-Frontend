# Duplicate Notification Fix - FINAL

## Problem
Users were receiving **2 notifications** for the same message:
1. **Socket notification**: "Ayman Quadri sent a message"
2. **Firebase notification**: "Ayman Quadri h: suppppp"

This happened because both socket notifications AND Firebase push notifications were being shown when the app was in foreground.

## Root Cause
The socket service was showing in-app notifications even when Firebase push notifications were already handling the same message, causing **duplicate notifications**.

## Solution
**Disabled socket notifications when app is in foreground** and let Firebase push notifications handle all notifications:

### Before (Duplicate Notifications)
```dart
if (_notificationService.isAppInForeground) {
  _notificationService.showInAppNotificationForMessage(...); // ‚ùå DUPLICATE
}
```

### After (Single Notification)
```dart
if (_notificationService.isAppInForeground) {
  // Disabled socket notification when app is in foreground
  // Firebase push notifications will handle the notification instead
} else {
  // Background notifications still work
}
```

## Files Modified

- `lib/services/socket_service.dart` - Disabled socket notifications in foreground

## Test Cases

| Scenario | Socket Notification | Firebase Notification | Result |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------|
| App in foreground | ‚ùå Disabled | ‚úÖ Show | ‚úÖ Single notification |
| App in background | ‚úÖ Show | ‚úÖ Show | ‚úÖ Single notification |
| User in chat | ‚ùå Disabled | ‚ùå Disabled | ‚úÖ No notification |

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ **No more duplicate notifications**
- ‚úÖ **Single notification source** (Firebase)
- ‚úÖ **Clean notification experience**
- ‚úÖ **Proper message content** (actual message text)
- ‚úÖ **Proper sender name** (actual sender name)

## Debug Logs

The fix includes clear logging:
```
üîî [SOCKET NOTIFICATION DEBUG] App in foreground - SKIPPING socket notification (Firebase will handle)
```

## Verification

1. **Deploy the changes**
2. **Test with real messages**:
   - Send a message when app is open ‚Üí Should see 1 Firebase notification
   - Send a message when app is closed ‚Üí Should see 1 Firebase notification
   - Be in chat with sender ‚Üí Should see 0 notifications

## Final Result

- ‚úÖ **Single notification per message**
- ‚úÖ **Proper message content** (not "sent a message")
- ‚úÖ **Proper sender name** (not "Someone")
- ‚úÖ **Clean user experience**

That's it! Simple fix for the duplicate notification issue. üéâ
