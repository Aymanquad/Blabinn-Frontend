# Image Cropping and Editing Feature

## Overview
This feature provides image editing capabilities for profile pictures and gallery images in the profile management flow. Users can rotate images before uploading them.

## Current Implementation

### Features
- **Image Rotation**: Users can rotate images using the built-in rotation editor
- **Preview Dialog**: Shows a preview of the image with editing options
- **Profile Pictures**: Circular preview for profile pictures
- **Gallery Images**: Rectangular preview for gallery images

### How It Works

1. **Image Selection**: User selects an image from gallery
2. **Editing Dialog**: A dialog appears with the image preview and options:
   - **Use As Is**: Uploads the image without any modifications
   - **Rotate**: Opens the rotation editor
   - **Cancel/Skip**: Cancels the operation

3. **Rotation Editor**: If user chooses "Rotate":
   - Opens a full-screen editor with rotation controls
   - User can adjust rotation angle with a slider
   - "Apply Rotation" button applies the changes
   - "Reset" button resets to original rotation
   - "Done" button saves the rotated image

### Files Modified

#### `lib/screens/profile_management_screen.dart`
- `_pickProfilePicture()`: Updated to show editing options after image selection
- `_pickGalleryImages()`: Updated to process multiple images with editing options
- `_showImageEditingOptions()`: New method that shows editing dialog for profile pictures
- `_showGalleryImageEditingOptions()`: New method that shows editing dialog for gallery images
- `_uploadGalleryImage()`: New method to upload gallery images

#### `lib/widgets/simple_image_cropper.dart`
- `SimpleImageCropper.showImageEditor()`: Provides rotation functionality
- `SimpleEditorDialog`: Full-screen rotation editor with slider controls

#### `pubspec.yaml`
- Added `image: ^4.1.7` for image processing
- Removed `image_cropper` dependency due to compatibility issues

### Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  image_picker: ^1.0.4
  image: ^4.1.7
```

### Usage Example

```dart
// For profile pictures
final editedFile = await _showImageEditingOptions(imageFile, true);

// For gallery images  
final editedFile = await _showGalleryImageEditingOptions(imageFile);

// For rotation only
final rotatedFile = await SimpleImageCropper.showImageEditor(
  context: context,
  imageFile: imageFile,
  title: 'Rotate Image',
);
```

## Technical Details

### Image Processing
- Uses the `image` package for rotation operations
- Images are processed in memory and saved to temporary files
- Quality is maintained at 80% for optimal file size

### UI Components
- **AlertDialog**: For editing options selection
- **SimpleEditorDialog**: Full-screen rotation editor
- **InteractiveViewer**: For image preview and interaction
- **Slider**: For rotation angle adjustment

### Error Handling
- Graceful error handling for image processing failures
- User-friendly error messages via SnackBar
- Fallback to original image if processing fails

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation focuses on rotation functionality. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Actual Cropping**: Implement real cropping based on user interaction
2. **Brightness/Contrast**: Add image adjustment controls
3. **Filters**: Add basic image filters
4. **Aspect Ratio**: Add aspect ratio controls for different image types

## Notes

- The current implementation prioritizes stability and simplicity
- Rotation functionality works reliably across different image formats
- The UI is responsive and user-friendly
- No additional Android/iOS configuration required for the current implementation
