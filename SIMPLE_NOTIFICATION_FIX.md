# Simple Notification Fix

## Problem
When a user is in a chat with a friend and that friend sends a message, the user receives an in-app notification even though they are already viewing the conversation.

## Solution
Simple check: **Don't show notification if user is currently in a chat with the sender**.

## Implementation

### 1. Socket Service (`lib/services/socket_service.dart`)

**Added tracking for current chat user:**
```dart
// Track current chat screen state
String? _currentChatWithUserId;

// Set current chat user (called when entering a chat)
void setCurrentChatUser(String? userId) {
  _currentChatWithUserId = userId;
  print('🔔 [SOCKET DEBUG] Current chat user set to: $_currentChatWithUserId');
}

// Clear current chat user (called when leaving a chat)
void clearCurrentChatUser() {
  _currentChatWithUserId = null;
  print('🔔 [SOCKET DEBUG] Current chat user cleared');
}
```

**Added check in message handler:**
```dart
// Don't show notification if we're currently in a chat with this sender
if (_currentChatWithUserId == senderId) {
  print('🔔 [SOCKET NOTIFICATION DEBUG] Skipping notification - currently in chat with sender');
  _messageController.add(message);
  return;
}
```

### 2. Chat Screen (`lib/screens/chat_screen.dart`)

**When entering chat:**
```dart
// Set current chat user to prevent notifications from this friend
_socketService.setCurrentChatUser(_friendId);
print('🔔 DEBUG: Set current chat user to: $_friendId');
```

**When leaving chat:**
```dart
// Clear current chat user to resume notifications from this friend
_socketService.clearCurrentChatUser();
print('🔔 DEBUG: Cleared current chat user on exit');
```

### 3. App Level (`lib/app.dart`)

**Added check in notification listener:**
```dart
// Check if user is currently in a chat with the sender
final senderId = notificationData['senderId'] ?? '';
final currentChatUserId = _socketService.currentChatWithUserId;

if (currentChatUserId == senderId) {
  print('🔔 [APP DEBUG] Skipping notification - user is in chat with sender');
  return;
}
```

## How It Works

1. **User opens chat** → `setCurrentChatUser(friendId)` is called
2. **Message arrives** → Check if `currentChatWithUserId == senderId`
3. **If match** → Skip notification ✅
4. **If no match** → Show notification ✅
5. **User leaves chat** → `clearCurrentChatUser()` is called
6. **Future messages** → Notifications resume ✅

## Test Cases

| Scenario | Current Chat User | Message From | Show Notification? |
|----------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Not in any chat | `null` | `friend123` | ✅ Yes |
| In chat with different friend | `friend456` | `friend123` | ✅ Yes |
| In chat with same friend | `friend123` | `friend123` | ❌ No |
| Left chat | `null` | `friend123` | ✅ Yes |

## Benefits

- ✅ **Simple**: Just one variable to track current chat
- ✅ **Reliable**: Works for all notification sources
- ✅ **Fast**: No database queries or complex logic
- ✅ **Clean**: Easy to understand and maintain
- ✅ **Complete**: Covers both socket and app-level notifications

## Debug Logs

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:
```
🔔 [SOCKET DEBUG] Current chat user set to: friend123
🔔 [SOCKET NOTIFICATION DEBUG] Skipping notification - currently in chat with sender
🔔 [SOCKET DEBUG] Current chat user cleared
```

## Usage

1. **Deploy the changes** to your Flutter app
2. **Test with real users**:
   - Open a friend chat
   - Send message from another device
   - Verify no notification appears
   - Leave chat and send another message
   - Verify notification appears

## Files Modified

- `lib/services/socket_service.dart` - Added chat user tracking
- `lib/screens/chat_screen.dart` - Set/clear current chat user
- `lib/app.dart` - Added notification check

That's it! Simple and effective solution. 🎉
