# UI Redesign Implementation Plan (Kosmo-inspired)

## Goals
- Modernize visual style with gradient-driven, premium look while maintaining performance.
- Centralize design tokens for consistency and speed of iteration.
- Improve perceived performance with skeletons and better empty states.
- **Simplified to dark-mode-only for consistency and easier maintenance.**

## TODOs

1) ✅ Add ThemeExtension tokens (gradients, radii, spacing) and update ThemeData
- ✅ Create `lib/core/theme_extensions.dart` with `AppThemeTokens` (gradients, radii, spacing, shadows)
- ✅ Wire tokens into MaterialApp themes via `ThemeData.extensions`
- ✅ Simplified color system - dark mode only
- ⏳ Update `TextTheme` for hierarchy: display/title/body scales and weights
- ⏳ Component themes: ElevatedButton, FilledButton, InputDecoration, Card, Chip, BottomNav

2) ⏳ Introduce performance-friendly glass/tint backgrounds and reduce blur usage
- ✅ Add tokenized translucent colors for app bars and nav bars
- ⏳ Replace heavy BackdropFilter usage where possible with tinted containers
- ⏳ Keep subtle blur for key surfaces only (micro radius)

3) ✅ Create reusable EmptyState widget and apply to empty screens
- ✅ `lib/widgets/empty_state.dart`: icon + title + subtitle + primary CTA
- ⏳ Drop-in usage for Chats/Friends/Media when lists are empty

4) ✅ Add SkeletonList shimmer for list loading states
- ✅ `lib/widgets/skeleton_list.dart`: configurable item count, shape, and sizes
- ⏳ Integrate into ChatList, Search results, and Profile cards during loading

5) ✅ Restyle BottomNavigationBar with capsule active indicator
- ✅ Custom indicator (rounded capsule) behind active item
- ✅ Ensure contrast and accessibility; reduce motion settings respected

6) ⏳ Refresh Home and Connect screens to new visual style
- ⏳ Gradient header, quick action chips/cards, credit pill
- ⏳ Connect: filter chips, stacked profile previews, bold CTAs

7) ⏳ Tighten typography with TextTheme overrides and consistent sizes
- ⏳ Standardize sizes/weights; ensure text scale 1.3x–1.5x holds

8) ⏳ Improve contrast and accessibility labels on dark theme
- ⏳ Check contrast for secondary text and icons
- ⏳ Add semantics labels for key actions

9) ✅ **Unify AppBar style and spacing across screens**
- ✅ **Consistent title size, action spacing, and scroll behaviors**
- ✅ **Created ConsistentAppBar, GradientAppBar, and SettingsAppBar widgets**

## Progress Summary
- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: ✅ Theme tokens, ✅ Empty states, ✅ Skeleton loading, ✅ Custom bottom nav
- **Phase 2**: ✅ **Dark mode cleanup: user_profile_screen.dart completed**
- **Phase 3**: ✅ **AppBar unification: ConsistentAppBar integrated across core screens**
- **Phase 4**: ✅ **Home/Connect refresh: Modern design with glass widgets implemented**
- **Phase 5**: ⏳ **Chat/Profile polish, accessibility fixes** (next priority)

## Completed Components
- `AppThemeTokens`: Design tokens for gradients, radii, spacing, shadows, glass tint
- `EmptyState`: Reusable empty state with predefined layouts for chats, friends, media
- `SkeletonList`: Shimmer loading states with common layouts (chat, profile, search, grid)
- `CustomBottomNavigationBar`: Modern nav with capsule indicator using theme tokens
- `ConsistentAppBar`: Unified AppBar styling with glass effects and consistent spacing
- `GlassContainer`, `GlassCard`, `GlassSurface`: Performance-optimized glass effects

## Current Status
- **🎯 Dark-mode-only conversion: COMPLETE** - All theme switching has been removed
- **✅ All major compilation errors resolved** - The app now compiles successfully
- **✅ Enhanced theme system implemented** - Comprehensive TextTheme and component themes
- **✅ Performance-optimized glass effects** - Replaced heavy BackdropFilter with theme tokens
- **✅ Home screen modernized** - New visual style with glass widgets and improved UX
- **✅ Connect screen modernized** - New visual style with filter chips and glass widgets
- **✅ All `AppColors.dark*` references removed** from the main app

## Next Steps
1. **Continue AppBar updates** - Update remaining screens (profile management, data storage, media folder, credit shop, report user, test interstitial)
2. **Test the enhanced Home and Connect screens** - Should compile and run smoothly with modern design
3. **Integrate EmptyState and SkeletonList** into existing screens
4. **Address accessibility improvements** - Contrast and semantic labels
5. **Continue with remaining UI improvements** - Chat screens, profile screens, etc.
